THE SHINY TUTORIAL IS OUTDATED AND MUST BE RENEWED!!!!

# Start the Shiny applications

First go to the installation path of the deisotoper package (normally it can be found at R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4/deisotoper/). There in the folder shiny the shiny applications are stored. Run the global.R to use them.


# Applications

## 'deisotoper' application

In the following the different tabs are described. 

### Deisotoping

In the 'Deisotoping' tab you can give the application an output path and when pressing on 'start deisotoper' it deisotopes the input data and writes it into the output destination. The configuration you can configurate will be used. For more information about configuration see 'Configuration'.

### Graph & Plot

In the 'Graph & Plot' tab you can plot and draw a graph for a specific isotopic set. The input data is used to generate this isotopic set and therefore it needs a configuration. For more information about configuration see 'Configuration'.

### Summary

In the 'Summary' tab you can summarize the input data and show one spectrum at one time, to have a good overview. This does not use the configuration.

### Statistic

In the 'Statistic' tab you can calculate a statistic about how much isotopic sets, isotopic clusters and so on are generated by the algorithm with the given configuration. For more information about configuration see 'Configuration'.

### Configuration

In the 'Configuration' tab you can configurate the configuration which is used in the other tabs. To gain more information read the description which is stated in the tab.

## 'diff_psm' application

This application is used to show the differences between two Mascot dat files, which were converted into RData files. You must insert a URL, but it works with data from the harddisk too.


### Mass Spectrum Plots

In the 'Mass Spectrum Plots' tab you can compare two plots of different Mascot dat files. To show the differences which are on mZ level you can tick the box 'show mZ diff', the same for intensity and ions. The tick box 'show delta' shows the distance from one peak to his neighbor peak. With the zoom bar you can zoom into the plot on the x-axis. The tolerance bar is used to define the tolerance for ion marks. You can navigate through the spactra via the scrollbar next to the tolerance bar.

### Mascot Score Plot

In the 'Mascot Score Plot' tab you can see the both data sets compared on Mascot score level. You can zoom into the plot by marking an area with your mouse. Double click to undo the zoom.
